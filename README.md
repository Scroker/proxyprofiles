# proxyprofiles
GNOME shell extension to swich easily between several proxy profiles.

This extension allows Linux GNome users to :
- quickly switch their proxy settings between none, manual or automatic.
- configure several profiles to quickly change system proxy settings.
- know if proxy is active or not and which profile is applied.
- configure proxy authentication, by profile, which is not easy to access with native GUI.

This is useful if your move your laptop from home to work every day, or if like me you work for several customers,
each one with its own network proxy settings: you will save some precious clicks ! :-)

## How to install / run

The easiest way is to install it from the GNome extension site.

To install it from the sources, clone the current repository and use the 'install.sh' script.

## Internationalization

French and English are handled. Default is English if detected locale is not handled.
